# OA-Policy-Appendix
An online appendix featuring the papers referenced in "Ocean Acidification Policy: Applying the Lessons of Washington to California and Beyond"

I originally prepared this document as a report to the Resources Legacy Fund (Matt Armsby), which I finalized in January 2017. I drafted and revised the document between July 2016 and January 2017, with feedback from George Leonary and Sarah Cooley at the Ocean Conservancy and from Matt Armsby.
